## Converting particle and decay lists from Thermal-FIST to Mathematica

These two small Jupyter notebook serve to convert particle and decay list files from the format used in [Thermal-FIST](https://github.com/vlvovch/Thermal-FIST) to the one, that can be copy-pasted into Mathematica notebooks that we use for our studies in Phys.Rev.C 102 (2020) 5, 054903 and Phys.Rev.C 107 (2023) 3, 034917.
